# CPE Containers

This containers should not be spread outside LUMI, and some even contain unofficial
versions and should not be spread to more users than needed.

To offer some security though obscurity the path where the container can be found,
is currently not shown in the EasyConfig file. Before installing, set the environment
variable EASYBUILD_SOURCEPATH to the directory where the sif file can be found.
