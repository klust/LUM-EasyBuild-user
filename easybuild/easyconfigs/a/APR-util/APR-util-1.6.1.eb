Apache Portable Runtime (APR) util libraries

The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent
interface to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal
is to provide an API to which software developers may code and be assured
of predictable if not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on
which their software is built, relieving them of the need to code s
pecial-case conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific d
eficiencies or features.
