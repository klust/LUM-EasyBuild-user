# seq-integer-headerlib

As there are many different packages called `seq` , or with `seq` as part of their 
name, we use a more descriptive name for the module.

This is a pure header library.

-   [`seq` on GitHub](https://github.com/n0phx/seq)
    
    -   [Releases via GitHub tags](https://github.com/n0phx/seq/tags)
    

## EasyBuild

There is no known EasyBuild or spack support for this package.


### seq 0.2.1 from LUMI/23.09 on

-   The EasyConfig was developed specifically for LUMI as there were no prior ones. 

-   As this is a pure header file library, it is built with the SYSTEM toolchain so
    that it can be used with all CPE toolchains.
