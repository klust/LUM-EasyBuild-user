## EasyBuild

  * [SQLite support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/main/easybuild/easyconfigs/s/SQLite)

  * [SQLite support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/s/SQLite)


### Version 3.36.0-static for SYSTEM

  * This is an installation for SQLite3 with fewer dependencies (based on a
    CSCS EasyConfig) meant for inclusion in syslibs, a module of static libraries
    used to build some tools that we want to run with minimal dependencies and compile
    with the SYSTEM compiler.
