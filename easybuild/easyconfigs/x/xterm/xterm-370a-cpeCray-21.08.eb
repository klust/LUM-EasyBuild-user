description = """
The xterm program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. It was
originally developed in the mid-1980s to provide DEC VT102 and Tektronix
4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window system
directly.

Each xterm window runs as a separate process. Some may run on remote
machines, using the X protocol to display on a local machine, while others
may run and display on the same local machine. X allows applications to update
their windows independently, but the local machine's keyboard and mouse are
shared, i.e., only delivering input events to the window which currently has
focus.

This version implements ISO/ANSI colors using the "new" color model (i.e.,
background color erase). It also implements most of the control sequences for
VT220, as well as selected features from other DEC terminals such as VT320,
VT420 and VT520.
