description = """
makedepf90 is a program for automatic creation of dependency lists and 
compilation rules for Makefiles.

The original idea was to provide the same functionality for Fortran as

gcc -MM *.c

does for C. Nowadays makedepf90 actually supersedes this functionality

This software is no longer maintained so is offered without any warranty
that it works properly or can continue to work on LUMI in the future.
It is fully offered "as-is", without support from the LUMI User Support
Team, unless someone would pick up development again.
