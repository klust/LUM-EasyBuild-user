### Version 2.4.2 -static for the SYSTEM toolchain

-   Developed a build procedure for a static version based on
    https://github.com/green-green-avk/build-proot-android/blob/master/make-talloc-static.sh.

    This is done specifically for use in proot which we want to be a fully static executable.
