## EasyBuild 

-   [pocl support in EasyBuild](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/p/pocl)

-   There is no support for pocl in the CSCS repository.


### Version 3.0 for cpeGNU/22.08

-   The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders one for version 1.8 as
    there was none yet for 3.0. 3.0 is needed however if Clan 14 is used.
    
UNFINISHED as building the necessary Clang 14.0.2 module is a rather complicated.
