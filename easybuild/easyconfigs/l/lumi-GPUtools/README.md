## EasyBuild

As this is a development of LUST, there is no support in other repositories.


### Version 0.1.0-alpha

-   The EasyConfig is our own development. It was developed in conjunction with the
    package itself, whose Makefile was already designed to work wel with EasyBuild.
    
-   We are using the SYSTEM toolchain so that the tools are completely independent
    of any version of the Cray PE and can be easyly used in the CrayEnv and LUMI
    environments.
