# User help for lumi-GPUtools

The lumi-GPUtools module provides tools to make life on the compute GPU partition of
LUMI a bit easier. It will grow over time.

Current tools:

-   `select_gpu: This command replaces the `select_gpu` script that is generated in
    the example job script in the 
    [section on MPI-based jobs](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/#mpi-based-job)
    in the [Run jobs - GPU examples section](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/scheduled-jobs/lumig-job/)
    of the LIUMI documentation.

Up-to-date information for the specific version of the module is available after 
installation of the module via the `module help lumi-GPUtools` command and after
loading of the module also via man pages. Use

```
man lumi-GPUtools
```

as a starting point.
