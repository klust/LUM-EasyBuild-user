### Version 1.9.3-static for SYSTEM

  * The EasyConfig file is a direct derivative from the one from the EasyBuilders repository.

  * The version with the SYSTEM toolchain is to prepare for inclusion in the syslibs
    module, a module of libraries used to build various small tools that we want to build
    against the SYSTEM toolchain with minimal runtime dependencies except for libraries
    included with the OS.
